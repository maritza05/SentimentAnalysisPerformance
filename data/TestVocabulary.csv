"MongoDB is a fast NoSQL database. Unfortunately, it’s not a cure for all your performance woes, and a single complex query can bring your code grinding to a halt. I recently suffered this fate, and it can be difficult to know where to look when your application suddenly becomes unstable.",0
"I wanted to compare speed with MongoDB and I ran a test which would get and print 15 records randomly from our huge databases. I ran the query about 1,000 times each for mysql and MongoDB and I am suprised that I do not notice a lot of difference in speed. Maybe MongoDB is 1.1 times faster. That's very disappointing. Is there something I am doing wrong? I know that my tests are not perfect but is MySQL on par with MongoDb when it comes to read intensive chores.",0

Couchbase performance is awesome,1
"Couchbase, performance is derived in part from the close understanding of the cluster topology by the SDK",1
Couchbase performance is consistently fast even under load,1
Couchbase performance is tied more to I/O and RAM capacity than it is to CPU,1
Couchbase performance is best,1
"One key to Couchbase performance is to watch your working set size, so the more working set items you can fit into memory, the better.",1
"Redis’ performance is quantifiable and measurable by tracking several key metrics, and by monitoring these you can gain insight into how well your database is performing.",1
Redis' performance is made up of two key factors: throughput and latency.,1
redis performance is no where close to that of mongodb.,0
"Redis performance is dominated by cache misses, so maybe we can compensate this with one indirection less?",0
"Although the Redis performance is better in a lot of cases, it is not the Holy Grail.",0
Redis performance is incredible.,1
Redis performance is never affected,1
"Redis performance is better than memcached there is to fill a bug or start a conversation, as there is something odd.",1
Redis performance is roughtly half that of Memcached.,0
The leading cause of poor Redis performance is reaching the upper limit of your plan's performance.,0
"redis performance is impacted by a large number of volatile keys, especially under memory pressure",0
Redis performance is generally sensitive to the size of the key fields in the KV store and the latency for servicing a KV cache,0
"Redis performance is very good, because it is pure memory operation, can handle more than 10 million times read and write operations per second, is the fastest known performance of Key-value DB.",1
